Create an exercise plan based on a goal and current ability.

# WIP: Add your own exercise

To add and track an exercise, input
- how much you can do now (in number of reps or duration)
- how much you would like to be able to do

The scheduler will then build a training plan that interpolates between your
current ability and your goal. 

# Default plans

Default plans exist for a handful of exercises.
